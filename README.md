# Emmet for Dreamweaver

[Emmet](http://emmet.io) is a web-developer’s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML & CSS workflow: write HTML code with CSS-like abbreviations, use different actions to quickly select and modify HTML and CSS code and more!

## Installation

Download [Emmet.zxp](http://download.emmet.io/dreamweaver/Emmet.zxp) and double-click on it: the *Adobe Extension Manager* should start automatically and install extension. If you don’t have Extension Manager, you can download it from [here](http://www.adobe.com/exchange/em_download/).

When installed, check out `Commands > Emmet` menu for available actions.

## Changing keyboard shortcuts

You can use default `Keyboard Shortcuts…` dialog to change action’s keyboard shortcuts.

## [Extensions support](http://docs.emmet.io/customization/)

Emmet for Dreamweaver supports extensions: you should open `Commands > Emmet > Emmet Preferences` dialog and enter absolute path to extentions folder. Unfortunately, Dreamweaver doesn’t support folder picking dialog so you have to type it manually.
